# You run a boat uber service, and your boat can only hold two passengers, excluding you,
# at a time. There three passengers that need to get across the river safely and in one piece. 
# They cannaot swim across the river becuase the currents are too strong
# and will most definately die. Your passengers are Ms Fox, Clive the Rooster, Poppie Corn.
# Ms Fox favourite dish is Chicken, while Clive really enjoys corn. The only reason they aren't
# make each other lunch is because you, so your job is to divise a plan to get them across!
